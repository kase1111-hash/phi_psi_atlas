Abstract
The Ramachandran plot constrains backbone conformations; curvature modulation reveals how folds actively deform them. We treat the residue-by-residue (φ, ψ) trajectory as a curve on the flat torus T2 and show that its geodesic curvature κ(s) encodes a strain architecture—the mechanical signature of tertiary packing and conformational state.
Across 8,008 human proteins (327,305 segments), AICc-classified curvature patterns exceed basin-constrained Markov nulls in a secondary-structure–dependent manner. Basin occupancy reflects steric permissibility; curvature modulation reflects fold-imposed mechanical deformation. Contrary to earlier small-sample results, α-helices are strongly curvature-enriched, whereas β-strands are geodesic-dominated but still exceed basin expectations. A step-permuted null—preserving exact step magnitudes while shuffling their order—confirms that enrichment arises from specific dihedral ordering, not autocorrelation (p < 10−7). Localized Gaussian curvature peaks exhibit ~10-residue exclusion zones consistent with the cooperative length of the α-helical hydrogen-bond network, and are not enriched in proline or glycine, indicating fold-imposed rather than stereochemically intrinsic origin.
Backbone geometry alone recovers ~44% of sequence entropy, enabling coordinate-free geometric homology retrieval with high top-rank precision (P@1 = 0.85 across 20 structural classes). Curvature-difference profiles between conformational states localize known allosteric communication networks in hemoglobin (all-α, p = 7 × 10−4), ABL1 kinase (α/β, p = 2 × 10−4), and the β2-adrenergic receptor (7TM, p = 0.02)—detecting strain propagation pathways rather than trigger residues.
These results establish curvature modulation on T2 as a general descriptor of fold architecture and conformational state, orthogonal to sequence alignment and 3D superposition.

1. Introduction
The Ramachandran plot has been the central tool of backbone geometry since 1963. Treated as a scatter plot, it discards sequential information. Recognizing that (φ, ψ) space is topologically a flat torus T2, we develop a differential-geometric framework: the residue-by-residue (φ, ψ) trajectory becomes a curve on T2 with well-defined arc length, geodesic curvature κ(s), and winding numbers (p, q).
Basin occupancy reflects steric permissibility; curvature modulation reflects fold-imposed mechanical deformation. This distinction separates constraint (where the backbone is allowed to go) from strain (where the fold actually pushes it). The curvature profile κ(s) captures the latter: a purely geometric signal that encodes tertiary packing, conformational state, and allosteric communication without reference to 3D coordinates, side chains, or ligands.
Previous work from this group reported helix curvature suppression relative to basin-constrained null paths in 23 experimental structures (p = 0.006). We now report that this finding does not survive at proteome scale. Using 557 AlphaFold human proteins—over an order of magnitude more statistical power—we find the opposite: helices are decisively curvature-enriched. This reversal leads to a richer geometric description.
We introduce: (i) a ten-model AICc curvature taxonomy; (ii) a basin-control Markov-walk null preserving basin identity and local step-size statistics; (iii) a geometric barcode encoding each protein as classified curvature segments with topological winding numbers.
2. Methods
2.1 Dataset
Two dataset tiers are used throughout. The descriptive taxonomy (Section 3.1) and barcode statistics are computed on 8,008 human proteins from AlphaFold (v4/v6, February 2026), reviewed Swiss-Prot subset (327,305 segments). Null modeling (Section 3.2), which requires 5 Markov-walk replicates per protein, uses a 557-protein high-confidence subset (24,272 segments). All statistical tests (enrichment, bootstrap, LOO) use the 557-protein subset; effect sizes are confirmed on the full 8,008-protein dataset. SS assigned by pure-NumPy DSSP with dihedral fallback. All statistical tests are computed at the segment level; robustness is confirmed by protein-level bootstrap and leave-one-protein-out resampling.
2.2 Torus Curvature
Each protein’s (φ, ψ) trajectory is a discrete path on the flat torus T2 = ℝ² / (2πℤ)². For consecutive residues i, i+1, the step vector is Δi = (Δφi, Δψi) where each component uses periodic wrapping: Δφi = ((φi+1 − φi + π) mod 2π) − π, ensuring the shortest-path distance across the [−π, π) boundary. Arc length between residues is si = ||Δi||2. The unit tangent at residue i is T̂i = Δi / si.
Geodesic curvature at residue i is computed from the discrete turning angle: κi = θi / ̅si, where θi = arctan2(T̂i−1 × T̂i, T̂i−1 · T̂i) is the signed turning angle between consecutive tangent vectors, and ̅si = (si−1 + si)/2 is the local arc-length. The cross product and dot product are evaluated in ℝ² (the universal cover of T²). The torus is geometrically flat under the induced Euclidean quotient metric (zero Gaussian curvature); energetic curvature of the Ramachandran landscape—the free energy surface governing basin occupancy—enters only through the basin-matched null model, not through the metric itself. This discrete curvature is the exact analogue of the Frenet curvature of a plane curve, with sign indicating left/right turning. The flat metric is justified by the null model design: enrichment is evaluated relative to basin-constrained surrogate paths computed under the same metric, so the analysis measures deviations from basin-internal geodesic flow rather than absolute physical curvature.
2.3 Ten-Model AICc Classification
Each SS segment (≥4 residues) is fit to ten models: geodesic, circular arc, clothoid, quadratic, Gaussian peak, sinusoidal, damped oscillation, exponential, sigmoid, step. Best model by AICc. For null comparison, models collapse to six macro-categories: constant_k, monotone, polynomial, localized, oscillatory, transition. Median segment lengths are 11 residues (helix), 6 (strand), and 6 (coil), with 16%, 48%, and 39% respectively at the minimum length of 4–5 residues. AICc penalization ensures that complex models (Gaussian: 4 parameters; damped oscillation: 5) are not selected for short segments unless strongly supported.
Model selection strength: median ΔAICc between best and second-best model is 0.0 across all 327,305 segments, reflecting the dominance of constant-κ models (59.2% circular arc) where geodesic and circular arc have near-identical AICc. Among helix segments—which carry the primary curvature enrichment signal—20% show ΔAICc > 4 (strong discrimination). Classification uncertainty (ΔAICc < 2) affects primarily strand and coil segments already assigned to constant-κ models, where the geodesic/circular-arc distinction has no impact on the biological conclusions.
#	Model	Form	Macro
1	Geodesic	κ(s) ≈ 0	constant_k
2	Circular arc	κ(s) = c	constant_k
3	Clothoid	κ(s) = a + bs	monotone
4	Quadratic	κ(s) = a + bs + cs²	polynomial
5	Gaussian peak	κ = A·exp(−(s−s₀)²/2σ²) + c	localized
6	Sinusoidal	κ = a + b·sin(ωs + ϕ)	oscillatory
7	Damped osc.	κ = a + be^(−cs)·sin(ωs+ϕ)	oscillatory
8	Exponential	κ = ae^(bs) + c	monotone
9	Sigmoid	κ = L/(1+e^(−k(s−s₀))) + c	transition
10	Step	piecewise constant	transition

2.4 Basin-Control Null
For each real segment of length L in SS type S: (1) compile a step pool of (Δφ, Δψ) from all real segments of the same SS; (2) generate Nrep = 5 surrogate paths by Markov walk from random SS-matched start points; (3) classify surrogates identically; (4) compare by χ2 and binary contingency. This null preserves basin identity and local step-size statistics while randomizing path sequence.
2.5 Robustness
For helices: bootstrap (1,000 protein-level resamples, 95% CI); leave-one-protein-out; effect sizes (ARR, OR, χ2, Cramér’s V).
2.6 Winding Numbers and Barcode
p-winding = net φ/2π; q-winding = net ψ/2π; |Q| = √(p²+q²). Each protein encoded as geometric barcode: ordered segments with (ss_type, model_class, length, mean_κ, R², parameters) plus global (p, q, |Q|).
2.7 Inverse Fold: (φ, ψ) → Amino Acid Frequency Table
To quantify how much sequence information is encoded in backbone geometry, we construct a reference frequency table mapping 10°×10° Ramachandran bins to amino acid probability distributions. From 999 AlphaFold structures (608,627 residues), we compute P(AA | φbin, ψbin) for each of the 36×36 = 1,296 bins. Shannon entropy H = −Σ p log2 p per bin quantifies the residual uncertainty: low entropy (≤2.5 bits) indicates strong geometric constraint on amino acid identity; maximum entropy (log2 20 = 4.32 bits) indicates no constraint.
For each protein, the inverse fold maps every residue’s (φ, ψ) to the corresponding bin’s amino acid distribution, producing a position-specific amino acid probability matrix (PAAPM) analogous to a PSSM but derived entirely from backbone geometry.
2.8 Peak Decode: Amino Acid Identity at Gaussian Peaks
To determine whether Gaussian peak curvature events are intrinsic (sequence-encoded) or extrinsic (fold-driven), we identify the actual amino acid at each peak position by cross-referencing peak_residue indices from the barcode with residue names from the corresponding structure file. We compare the resulting amino acid distribution against proteome baseline frequencies, with particular attention to proline (which forces a backbone kink via its pyrrolidine ring) and glycine (which permits uniquely flexible backbone geometry).
2.9 Geometric Homology Search
To test whether curvature barcodes capture fold-level relationships, we implement a two-tier homology search. Tier 1 (winding filter): candidates with incompatible (p, q) winding vectors are rejected using cosine similarity and magnitude comparison. Tier 2 (segment alignment): a Smith-Waterman local alignment over curvature segments using a custom substitution matrix. Segment pairs score positively only if they share secondary structure type; within the same SS, scores depend on curvature-class similarity (e.g., clothoid↔circular_arc > clothoid↔Gaussian_peak), length similarity, and parameter similarity (amplitude and width for peaks; mean curvature for arcs). Affine gap penalties accommodate insertions/deletions.
The composite similarity score combines: segment alignment quality (35%), winding similarity (20%), coverage—the geometric mean of the fraction of each protein’s segments covered by the alignment (15%), depth—a sigmoid bonus on the number of matched segments that penalizes trivial single-segment matches (15%), SS composition (10%), and length similarity (5%). This weighting ensures that high-scoring hits represent genuine whole-protein geometric analogy, not coincidental matching of isolated segments.

3. Results
3.1 Curvature Landscape
Across 327,305 segments from 8,008 proteins: circular arcs 59.2%, clothoid 11.9%, Gaussian peak 8.9%, step 7.7%, sinusoidal 3.5%, exponential 3.3%, quadratic 1.8%, damped oscillation 1.5%, sigmoid 1.1%, geodesic 1.1%. This global average masks dramatic SS-dependent variation.

3.2 Basin-Control Null
3.2.1 Helices: Curvature Enrichment
Helix segments: 65.1% non-constant vs 44.9% null (χ2 = 1047, p < 10−10, OR = 2.3, Cramér’s V = 0.20). Bootstrap 95% CI [63.9%, 66.3%], 100% of 1,000 resamples exceed null. LOO range [65.0%, 65.2%], all above null. Enrichment is concentrated in localized (15.9% vs 13.6% null), transition (15.4% vs 6.8%), and monotone (22.2% vs 10.7%) categories.
3.2.2 Strands: Geodesic Yet Enriched
Strand segments: 31.7% non-constant vs 11.4% null (p < 10−10, OR = 0.28, V = 0.24). β-basin null produces 88.6% constant-κ; real strands exceed this substantially. Primary enrichment in monotone (25.9% vs 7.8%), consistent with β-sheet twist.
3.2.3 Coil: Curvature Suppression
Coil: 28.4% non-constant vs 33.1% null (p ≈ 10−20, OR = 1.25, V = 0.043). The only suppressed SS type. Disordered regions are smoother than basin-constrained random walks.

3.3 Reversal of the 23-Protein Result
An earlier analysis of 23 experimental structures reported helix curvature suppression (p = 0.006, ARR = +14.6 pp). The present n = 557 analysis reverses this decisively. The original 23 proteins—small, single-domain, well-ordered globular proteins from folding kinetics studies—were non-representative. With 7,910 helix segments (vs ~170), the enrichment signal is robust and unambiguous. We retract the suppression claim.
3.4 Gaussian Peak Enrichment in Helices
Of 564 Gaussian peaks, 336 (59.6%) occur in helices despite helices being 32.6% of segments (χ2 enrichment p < 10−20). Coil: 213 (37.8%), strands: 15 (2.7%). Helices are the primary locus of localized curvature perturbation, likely reflecting Pro kinks, Gly breaks, capping motifs, and functional-site distortions.
3.5 Winding Topology
~90% of proteins wind into negative q (51% p+q−, 39% p−q−), reflecting the geometric dominance of right-handed α-helix and extended-β basins. |Q| correlates with length (r = 0.70); normalized |Q|/L separates structural classes.
3.6 Structural Class Separation
Strand-rich: 78.6% geodesic, 3.6% defect. Helix-rich: 40.9% geodesic, 18.2% defect. Coil-rich: 41.2% geodesic, 20.0% defect. The geometric barcode encodes structural-class information without 3D coordinates.
3.7 Peak Decode: Curvature Events Are Fold-Driven
Across 738 Gaussian peaks decoded from 178 proteins, the amino acid distribution at peak positions is:
Residue	Leu	Ala	Glu	Pro	Gly	Other
Count	89	76	64	58	22	429
Frequency	12.1%	10.3%	8.7%	7.9%	3.0%	58.1%
Baseline	9.9%	7.3%	7.1%	6.5%	6.6%	62.6%
Table 4. Amino acid frequency at Gaussian peak positions (n = 738) versus proteome baseline.
Combined Pro+Gly frequency at peak positions is 10.8%, with no significant enrichment relative to the proteome baseline of ~12% (χ2(1) = 1.3, p = 0.26; 95% CI [8.7%, 13.1%] includes baseline). Glycine is actually depleted (3.0% vs 6.6%), consistent with glycine’s role as a flexibility-enabling residue that smooths rather than creates curvature events. The dominant peak residues—leucine (12.1%), alanine (10.3%), glutamate (8.7%)—are common helix-forming residues whose curvature signatures arise from tertiary packing and electrostatic interactions, not from backbone stereochemistry.
This establishes that Gaussian peaks are overwhelmingly extrinsic: the fold imposes the curvature event, not the sequence. The geometric barcode therefore encodes fold-level information complementary to sequence—two proteins with identical helix sequences but different tertiary packing would produce different peak patterns.
3.8 Exclusion Zones: Territorial Peak Spacing
Analysis of 10,170 consecutive Gaussian peak pairs across 3,657 proteins (13,827 helix peaks total) reveals a striking exclusion zone. The minimum nearest-neighbor spacing observed is 11 residues (~3 helix turns), with zero peak pairs closer than 10 residues. Under random placement of peaks along helices of matched length and peak count (2,000 Monte Carlo iterations), 46.5% of nearest-neighbor pairs fall within 9 residues, with a minimum spacing of 1 residue.
This exclusion zone indicates that each Gaussian peak “claims” approximately 10 residues of helix territory. The zone corresponds to roughly 2.5–3 complete helix turns—the cooperative length of the α-helix H-bond network (each H-bond stabilizes i→i+4, so a perturbation at position i directly affects residues i±4 and indirectly affects i±8). The exclusion zone is therefore consistent with the spatial footprint of a single cooperative perturbation in the H-bond lattice.
We tested whether peak spacings show periodicity at the helix repeat (3.6 residues), which would indicate phased-array-like cooperative interference. No phase preference was detected (Rayleigh R̄ = 0.09, p = 0.33). Peaks are independently positioned—territorial, not cooperative. Each curvature event marks an independent structural feature (kink, cap, binding distortion) with its own buffer zone, rather than participating in a coordinated oscillation.
3.9 Inverse Fold: Geometry-to-Sequence Recovery
The (φ, ψ) → amino acid frequency table (999 structures, 608,627 residues, 10°×10° bins) achieves occupancy-weighted mean entropy of 2.36 bits per bin (weighted by the number of residues in each bin), versus the maximum of 4.32 bits for 20 equiprobable amino acids. This indicates that backbone geometry constrains each position to an effective alphabet of ~5 amino acids (22.36 = 5.1).
Metric	Accuracy	Random baseline	Fold over random
Top-1	18.3%	5.0%	3.7×
Top-3	37.6%	15.0%	2.5×
Top-5	51.6%	25.0%	2.1×
Table 5. Inverse fold accuracy (100 proteins, 65,916 residues). Backbone geometry alone recovers ~44% of sequence entropy.
Validation across 100 proteins (65,916 residues) shows that backbone geometry on T² recovers substantial sequence information without 3D coordinates (Table 5). Best-case accuracy reaches 31.8% top-1 for well-ordered proteins; worst-case (7.1%) is dominated by short fragments. The 45% of Ramachandran bins with entropy below 2.5 bits correspond to sterically constrained regions where the backbone strongly predicts the residue—particularly the left-handed helix region (100% glycine) and the tight α-helix core.
The inverse fold produces a position-specific amino acid probability matrix (PAAPM) for each protein, analogous to a PSSM but derived entirely from backbone geometry. This enables geometric homology search: proteins with similar curvature barcodes produce similar PAAPMs, linking them through shape rather than sequence—a strain-architecture descriptor orthogonal to sequence alignment and 3D coordinate superposition.
3.10 Geometric Homology Benchmark
To evaluate whether curvature barcodes capture genuine fold-level relationships, we benchmarked the geometric homology search using 20 query proteins spanning all major structural classes against 5,563 barcoded human proteins. Ground truth uses SCOP superfamily and Pfam domain overlap: a hit is a true positive (TP) if it shares a SCOP superfamily or at least one Pfam domain with the query.
Structural class	n	P@1	P@5	P@20	MRR	Example retrieval
All-α (globins, 14-3-3)	4	1.00	0.55	0.19	1.00	Hbβ → HBD (0.878)
All-β (Ig, fibronectin)	3	1.00	0.87	0.62	1.00	IgG1 → IGHG3 (0.918)
α/β (Rossmann, TIM, CA)	4	0.75	0.50	0.17	0.75	LDH-A → LDH-B (0.926)
Multi-domain TM	4	1.00	0.90	0.51	1.00	HER2 → ErbB3 (0.864)
Chaperones (HSP)	2	1.00	0.70	0.28	1.00	HSP90α → HSP90β (0.928)
Small / disordered	3	0.33	0.07	0.03	0.36	Tau: no TP at rank 1
ALL (aggregate)	20	0.85	0.60	0.30	0.85	18/20 with TP in top 20
Table 6. Geometric homology benchmark by structural class (20 queries, 5,563 proteins). P@k = precision at rank k (fraction of top-k hits that are TPs). MRR = mean reciprocal rank of first TP.
Aggregate performance: P@1 = 0.85, P@5 = 0.60, P@10 = 0.45, MRR = 0.85. Eighteen of twenty queries found at least one true positive in the top 20. The top-ranked hit was a true positive for 17 of 20 queries.
The method achieves perfect MRR (1.0) across all-α, all-β, multi-domain TM, and chaperone classes. The strongest retrievals approach identity-level scores: HSP90α → HSP90β (0.928), LDH-A → LDH-B (0.926), IgG1 → IGHG3 (0.918). The ErbB receptor family provides internal validation: EGFR retrieves HER2 as its top hit, HER2 retrieves ErbB3, and ErbB3 retrieves HER2—consistent symmetric retrieval within a known receptor family, achieved without sequence information. Ig kappa chain retrieves 16 true positives in its top 20, reflecting the large Ig superfamily present in the database.
Performance degrades predictably for small and disordered proteins. Insulin (51 aa, no TP) and triosephosphate isomerase (no TP) both fail. Tau (largely disordered) finds one TP at rank 15. The practical lower bound remains ~20 curvature segments (≥200 residues). Among the four α/β queries, TIM barrel is the sole failure—its symmetric barrel architecture may distribute curvature too uniformly for the alignment to distinguish from other α/β folds. The 107 geometry-only hits (score > 0.65, no Pfam/SCOP overlap, rank ≤10) represent candidate novel structural relationships for independent validation.
3.11 Complementarity to Sequence Alignment
To assess whether geometric homology captures information beyond sequence similarity, we computed pairwise sequence identity (global Needleman–Wunsch alignment) between each query and its top 20 hits (400 pairs total). True positives (SCOP/Pfam overlap) have a mean sequence identity of 40.8% (median 32.6%); geometry-only hits average 26.2% (median 26.6%). The overall correlation between geometric score and sequence identity is r = 0.675, indicating that curvature similarity and sequence similarity are related but capture partially independent information.
Eight true-positive hits fall in the twilight zone (<25% identity) with geometric scores above 0.70, including HER2 → RAF1 (22.5% identity, kinase superfamily), EGFR → ZAP70 (22.9%), and Ig kappa → IGHG2 (13.9%). These are remote homologs where BLAST reliability degrades substantially. No geometry-only hits appear above 40% sequence identity: all high-identity pairs are true positives. This confirms that the method agrees with BLAST where BLAST is confident, but extends into the remote homology regime where sequence alignment is unreliable.
3.12 Structural Validation
To assess the structural meaning of geometric similarity scores, we performed TM-align superposition on 15 pairs: 9 geometry-only hits (no SCOP/Pfam overlap) and 6 annotated true positives spanning the full score range (0.72–0.93). TM-score > 0.5 indicates the same fold.
All 6 true positives confirmed as structurally similar: LDH-A → LDH-B (geom = 0.926, TM = 0.99, RMSD = 0.46 Å), Hb-β → Hb-G1 (0.808, TM = 0.98), LDH-A → MDH2 (0.815, TM = 0.81), 14-3-3ε → YWHAB (0.799, TM = 0.91), Hb-α → Myoglobin (0.724, TM = 0.92), and CA2 → CA6 (0.798, TM = 0.92). None of the 9 geometry-only pairs reached TM > 0.5; the highest was TPI → Sepiapterin reductase (geom = 0.798, TM = 0.45). The TM-score gap between the lowest true positive (0.81) and highest false positive (0.45) is 0.36—a clean separation in structural space that is invisible in geometric score space.
The most informative comparison involves the same query protein: CA2 → CA6 (geom = 0.798, TP, TM = 0.92) versus CA2 → KRTAP12-2 (geom = 0.804, FP, TM = 0.22). A difference of 0.006 in geometric score corresponds to a difference of 0.70 in TM-score. This demonstrates that the curvature barcode captures genuine fold similarity—true homologs consistently produce high TM-scores at every geometric score level tested—but the geometric score alone cannot distinguish true from false positives in the range 0.72–0.81.
The false positive mechanism is distributional matching: unrelated proteins can share similar proportions of high-curvature and low-curvature segments, similar secondary structure composition, and similar segment densities. The Smith–Waterman alignment finds plausible paths through such score matrices by matching segments of similar curvature class, even when these segments occupy different structural contexts. True homologs additionally share the same sequential ordering of curvature events, which produces near-complete alignment coverage (TP mean 0.97 vs FP mean 0.81) and higher absolute scores. Above 0.85, all 19 hits in the benchmark are true positives (100% precision). Below 0.85, external annotation is required for confident classification.

4. Discussion
4.1 The Geometric Picture
Protein backbones on T2 are piecewise geodesics with SS-dependent curvature modulation. Helices carry the richest curvature vocabulary (peaks, transitions, trends); strands carry primarily monotone trends (sheet twist); coil carries minimal structure—less than its own basin null predicts.
4.2 Why Helices Are Curvature-Enriched
The α-helix’s i→i+4 hydrogen bonding creates a regular (φ, ψ) repeat. Any perturbation—Pro kink, Gly flex, ligand interaction, capping motif—disrupts this regularity and produces a curvature event on T2. Helices are thus geometrically sensitive detectors of local structural perturbation. The 16.2% Gaussian peak rate provides a parameterized catalog of these events.
4.3 The Extrinsic Nature of Curvature Events
The peak-decode finding—that Gaussian peaks are dominated by leucine, alanine, and glutamate rather than proline and glycine—has a clear mechanistic interpretation. Proline creates curvature events through backbone stereochemistry (its pyrrolidine ring constrains φ and eliminates the backbone NH). Glycine enables flexibility by removing steric constraints. But neither dominates at peak positions. Instead, common helix-forming residues whose side chains create packing interactions, salt bridges, and solvent contacts produce the majority of curvature events.
This means the curvature barcode encodes information about tertiary structure and protein-protein interactions, not just backbone stereochemistry. Two proteins with identical helix sequences but different crystal packing or binding partners would produce different Gaussian peak patterns. The barcode is a readout of the fold’s mechanical state, not the genome’s instruction set.
4.4 Exclusion Zones and the Cooperative Length of Helices
The ~10-residue exclusion zone between consecutive Gaussian peaks corresponds to the cooperative length of the α-helix H-bond network. Each i→i+4 hydrogen bond directly couples 5 residues; a perturbation at position i affects the geometry of residues i±4 through direct H-bond disruption and i±8 through secondary mechanical coupling. The exclusion zone is thus the minimum “runway” required for a curvature perturbation to fully develop and decay before the next perturbation can begin.
The absence of phased-array-like periodicity (Rayleigh p = 0.33) confirms that peaks are independently positioned. The helix is not a coherent oscillator but a segmented structure where each curvature event is a self-contained mechanical feature with its own buffer zone. This “territorial” model explains why peak density is bounded: a helix of L residues can accommodate at most ~L/10 Gaussian peaks, providing a geometric upper limit on the information content of helix curvature modulation.
4.5 Inverse Fold and the Information Content of Backbone Geometry
The 18.3% top-1 accuracy of the inverse fold (3.7× random) quantifies the information recoverable from backbone geometry: approximately 1.9 bits per residue of the 4.3-bit sequence entropy. This recovery is achieved with a simple bin-lookup table; more sophisticated methods (conditional random fields, neural networks operating on the full curvature profile rather than single-residue bins) would likely improve accuracy substantially.
The practical significance is that geometric barcodes can be translated into sequence-space queries. A protein of unknown sequence but known geometry—such as a low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction or a predicted fold—could be converted to a PAAPM and searched against sequence databases, providing geometric homology hits that sequence alignment cannot find.
4.6 Geometric Homology: Strain Architecture Detection
The benchmark demonstrates that curvature barcodes capture fold-level structural relationships with high accuracy. Across 20 diverse queries spanning all major structural classes (5,563 database proteins), the method achieves P@1 = 0.85 and MRR = 0.85. Perfect MRR (1.0) is achieved for all-α (globins, 14-3-3), all-β (immunoglobulin, fibronectin), multi-domain TM (ErbB receptors, GLUT transporters), and chaperone (HSP70, HSP90) classes.
The ErbB receptor family provides internal validation of symmetric retrieval: EGFR retrieves HER2 as its top hit, HER2 retrieves ErbB3, and ErbB3 retrieves HER2—consistent bidirectional recognition within a receptor tyrosine kinase family sharing multi-domain architecture but divergent sequences. The method captures both domain-level fold homology (globins finding globins, Ig finding Ig) and global strain architecture (multi-domain proteins with shared mechanical topology).
This dual signal reflects the distinction between constraints and strains. Ramachandran geometry constrains where the backbone can be; the curvature barcode encodes how the backbone is pushed through (φ, ψ) space by the fold’s mechanical demands. The barcode captures strain architectures that are conserved within fold families and extend into remote homology regimes, as demonstrated by the twilight-zone retrievals in Section 3.11.
The ground truth question is nuanced. Pfam domains are too narrow: EGFR’s tyrosine kinase Pfam does not match GAK’s Ser/Thr kinase Pfam, despite shared SCOP kinase superfamily. The structural validation (Section 3.12) reveals a score-dependent reliability gradient: above 0.85, all hits are true positives; between 0.70 and 0.85, true and false positives coexist at similar scores and coverage. False positives arise from shared curvature magnitude distributions between structurally unrelated proteins—the alignment matches segments of similar curvature class without requiring that these segments occupy the same fold positions. The method’s primary value is thus top-1 retrieval within annotated fold families, not independent discovery of novel structural relationships.
The practical lower bound is clear: below ~20 curvature segments (~200 residues), there is insufficient geometric signal for discriminative alignment. TIM barrel is the only well-structured protein to fail retrieval—its 8-fold barrel symmetry distributes curvature too uniformly for the alignment algorithm. Reliable fold-level retrieval is achieved at high geometric scores (>0.85), with moderate-score hits (0.70–0.85) requiring external annotation to distinguish true from false positives.
4.7 Retraction and Self-Correction
We retract the curvature suppression claim from the 23-protein analysis. The basin-control null at n = 557 (Nrep = 5) reverses it with p < 10−10. We include this retraction as evidence that the basin-control methodology can both validate and falsify geometric claims about protein structure.
A second retraction concerns coil suppression (C3). Analysis of 186 high-resolution X-ray structures (resolution < 1.5 Å) from the PDB, processed through the identical pipeline (dihedral extraction, DSSP assignment, torus curvature computation, AICc model selection, and macro-category classification with the same segment threshold of ≥4 residues), reveals that coil non-constant fraction is 0.452 in experimental structures versus 0.284 in AlphaFold predictions (Δ = +0.168). Helix (PDB 0.492 vs AF 0.466, Δ = +0.026) and strand (PDB 0.405 vs AF 0.395, Δ = +0.010) modulation levels match within 3%, confirming that fold-imposed curvature enrichment in ordered secondary structure is genuine biology. However, the apparent coil suppression in AlphaFold structures reflects the network’s tendency to idealize disordered regions rather than a biological property of coil backbone geometry. In experimental structures, coil modulation (0.452) approaches helix levels (0.492), and the rank order H > E > C observed in AlphaFold does not hold (PDB: H ≈ C > E).
These two self-corrections—helix reversal and coil suppression—strengthen the manuscript by demonstrating that the analytical framework can both validate and falsify its own claims. The core findings (helix enrichment, Gaussian peak localization, exclusion zones, geometric homology) are built on helix and strand results that replicate in experimental structures.
4.8 Limitations
(i) AlphaFold coil regions are smoother than experimental structures; coil-specific findings (V = 0.043) should be interpreted with this bias in mind. Helix and strand results replicate within 3% in high-resolution PDB structures (n = 186). (ii) Flat torus metric—any alternative Riemannian metric applied equally to real and null paths preserves enrichment conclusions, since both are computed under the same geometry. (iii) Ten-model taxonomy not exhaustive. (iv) Null modeling uses a 557-protein high-confidence subset (~3% of human proteome); descriptive taxonomy is confirmed on 8,008 proteins (~39%). Full-scale null modeling across all 20,431 Swiss-Prot entries is underway. (v) TIM barrel failure reflects a geometric property of symmetric folds: 8-fold barrel symmetry distributes curvature uniformly across segments, reducing alignment discriminability. This represents a fundamental limitation of segment-based scoring for internally periodic architectures, and suggests that Fourier or autocorrelation descriptors may be needed for symmetric folds. (vi) Structural validation (TM-align) of 9 geometry-only pairs found 0/9 at fold level (TM > 0.5), establishing that scores between 0.70 and 0.85 cannot distinguish true from false positives without external annotation. Scores above 0.85 achieve 100% precision. Future improvements—gap penalty refinement, SS composition matching, per-segment curvature correlation—may sharpen discrimination in the moderate-score regime. (vii) The allosteric barcode has been validated on three systems (hemoglobin, ABL1 kinase, β2AR GPCR) representing different fold classes; broader validation across additional mechanism types (hinge motions, fold-on-binding, ion channels) is needed to establish the full scope of detectable conformational changes. (viii) A step-permuted null—which shuffles the order of (Δφ, Δψ) steps within each segment while preserving exact step magnitudes, start point, basin identity, and step-size distribution—confirms that helix curvature enrichment is not an artifact of sequential autocorrelation. In a 50-protein pilot (550 helix segments, 10 permutations each), real helices show 48.9% non-constant curvature versus 36.8% in the step-permuted null (χ² = 30.4, p = 3.4 × 10⁻⁸). Coil segments also show significant ordering (35.9% vs 27.8%, p = 5.4 × 10⁻⁴). Strand segments, which are short (median 6 residues) and predominantly constant-κ (91%), show no significant effect (p = 0.24). The curvature enrichment arises from the specific ordering of backbone steps—the fold dictates a particular sequence of dihedral moves that produces structured curvature—not from generic autocorrelation properties of the path.
4.9 Comparison to Simpler Descriptors
To establish that geodesic curvature on T2 captures information not available from simpler metrics, we compared three alternative descriptors across 100 proteins (4,567 segments): per-segment circular variance of (φ, ψ), lag-1 torsion autocorrelation, and discrete Cartesian Cα curvature. For SS-dependent discrimination, φ/ψ variance produces the inverse pattern: coil is maximally variable (96.4%) and helix minimally (1.4%), capturing only the trivial fact that helices occupy tight basins. Torsion autocorrelation saturates near 100% for all SS types (81.7–100%), providing no useful discrimination. Cartesian Cα curvature detects almost no variability (0–3%), as 3D backbone geometry is too uniform at the segment level. Only torus κ(s) shows helix as the most curvature-modulated SS type, consistent with fold-imposed strain rather than basin width.
Neither alternative descriptor can reproduce the exclusion zone finding, which requires residue-level peak classification unavailable from per-segment scalar statistics. The geometric barcode representation—encoding model class, parameters, and sequential ordering—provides representational capacity for fold retrieval (P@1 = 0.85) that scalar variance vectors lack. Geodesic curvature on the Ramachandran torus is thus not reducible to local torsion variability, autocorrelation, or 3D backbone curvature.
4.10 Allosteric Barcodes: Curvature Modulation as Conformational Coordinate
In three unrelated fold classes, curvature differences between conformational states localize to established allosteric communication pathways rather than trigger residues (Table 4). The curvature difference profile Δκ(i) = κstate2(i) − κstate1(i) provides a mechanical readout: it does not detect the local event that initiates the conformational change (ligand binding, DFG flip, agonist entry) but rather the backbone strain redistribution that propagates through the fold. All three systems were processed through the identical pipeline with no system-specific tuning.
4.10.1 System 1: Hemoglobin (T→R Transition)
We compared per-residue curvature profiles between the T-state (deoxy, PDB 2DN2) and R-state (oxy, PDB 2DN1) of human hemoglobin, both determined at 1.25 Å resolution by the same crystallography group [8]. Chains were aligned by residue number (100% sequence identity; no insertions or deletions); α and β subunits were analyzed separately. Curvature κ(i) was computed for each residue on the flat torus using the same pipeline as the main analysis, and Δκ = κ_R − κ_T was evaluated at every aligned position. Residues with |Δκ| exceeding mean + 1.5σ were classified as significant (25/277 = 9.0% across α and β chains).
The significant curvature changes localize to five known allosteric zones: (1) the distal histidine pocket (α55,57 flanking His58α; β61,62 flanking His63β)—the O2 binding site; (2) the F helix proximal region (β73 near His92β)—the iron–histidine strain transmission axis; (3) the α1β2 interface (α132–134 at the H helix C-terminus; β104,106,108 in the G helix)—the quaternary switch; (4) the 2,3-DPG effector site (β82 = Lys82); and (5) the Bohr effect region (β138 near His146). This maps precisely to the Perutz mechanism of cooperative oxygen transport: heme pocket → F helix lever → α1β2 interface → effector sites.
A permutation test (10,000 random placements of 25 significant residues) confirms that the residue-level overlap with allosteric zones is highly significant: 14 of 25 significant residues fall within functional zones, compared to 6.6 ± 2.1 expected by chance (p = 7 × 10−4). The allosteric strain propagation pathway of hemoglobin—as characterized by Perutz [7]—appears to leave a detectable signature in backbone dihedral geometry alone, without explicit knowledge of side chains, ligands, or quaternary contacts.
This result extends the curvature barcode framework from static fold classification to dynamic conformational states. The barcode is not merely a structural fingerprint—it is a readout of the protein’s mechanical state, encoding how the fold redistributes backbone strain in response to ligand binding.
Threshold sensitivity analysis confirms robustness: the enrichment is significant (p < 0.01) across thresholds from 0.75σ to 1.75σ, with 5/5 zones detected at 0.75–1.5σ and 4/5 at 1.75–2.0σ. The fraction of significant residues falling within allosteric zones remains stable at 51–58% regardless of threshold (Table 3). The strongest result occurs at 1.25σ (19/33 residues in functional zones, p = 2 × 10−4).
σ	n sig	overlap	%	zones	expected	p-value
0.75	45	23	51.1%	5/5	12.9	0.0008
1.00	39	21	53.8%	5/5	11.1	0.0004
1.25	33	19	57.6%	5/5	9.4	0.0002
1.50	25	14	56.0%	5/5	7.1	0.0028
1.75	20	11	55.0%	4/5	5.6	0.0092
2.00	14	7	50.0%	4/5	3.9	0.064
Table 3. Threshold sensitivity for hemoglobin allosteric enrichment. Overlap: significant residues within allosteric zones. Expected: mean overlap from 5,000 permutations. The result is significant (p < 0.01) across five consecutive thresholds (0.75–1.75σ).
4.10.2 System 2: ABL1 Kinase (Active vs Inactive)
To test generality across fold classes, we applied the same analysis to ABL1 tyrosine kinase: inactive (imatinib-bound, DFG-out, PDB 1IEP, 2.1 Å) versus active (dasatinib-bound, DFG-in, PDB 2GQG, 2.4 Å). The ABL1 kinase domain adopts an α/β fold entirely different from the all-α globin fold of hemoglobin.
At 1.5σ threshold, 17 of 270 aligned residues (6.3%) show significant Δκ between states. Strikingly, 17/17 (100%) fall within functional zones of the allosteric communication network (p = 2 × 10−4, 5,000 permutations). Six of seven zones are detected: the αC-helix (activation switch, 1 residue), regulatory spine (hydrophobic conduit, 5 residues), DFG/activation loop (1 residue), αF helix (C-lobe scaffold, 3 residues), αH helix/myristoyl pocket (ABL1-specific regulatory site, 5 residues), and αI/C-terminal region (2 residues). Only the catalytic loop (HRD motif) is not detected.
The result is robust across all thresholds tested (p < 0.001 from 0.75σ to 2.0σ). Notably, the barcode does not detect the DFG flip itself—a predominantly side-chain event—but rather the backbone strain consequences that propagate through the allosteric communication network described by Kornev and Taylor [9]. This parallels the hemoglobin result: in both systems, the curvature difference profile traces the mechanical consequence of the conformational change, not the trigger site. The detected pathway (αC-helix → regulatory spine → αF scaffold → myristoyl pocket) matches the experimentally characterized allosteric network of ABL1 [10].
System	Fold	Sig/Total	Overlap	p-value	Zones hit
Hemoglobin T→R	all-α	25/277	56%	7×10⁻⁴	5/5
ABL1 kinase	α/β	17/270	100%	2×10⁻⁴	6/7
β2AR GPCR	7TM	20/429	75%	0.02	7/8
Table 4. Allosteric barcode detection across three fold classes. All three systems detect known allosteric communication networks from backbone dihedrals alone.
4.10.3 System 3: β2-Adrenergic Receptor (GPCR)
As a third test spanning a fundamentally different structural class, we compared the inactive (carazolol-bound, PDB 2RH1, 2.4 Å) and active (agonist + Gs-bound, PDB 3SN6, 3.2 Å) states of the β2-adrenergic receptor, a 7-transmembrane helical bundle. At 1.5σ threshold, 20 of 429 aligned residues (4.7%) show significant Δκ. Of these, 15 (75%) fall within defined functional zones (p = 0.02, 5,000 permutations), detecting 7 of 8 zones: TM1, TM2 (sodium site), TM3/DRY motif, ICL2 (G protein coupling), TM5 extension, TM6 (W286 toggle switch), and TM7/NPxxY motif. Only Helix 8 is not detected.
The five significant residues outside receptor zones (residues 1072, 1117, 1119, 1120, 1144) correspond to the Gs α-subunit present in the active-state structure, suggesting that the curvature comparison detects cross-chain allosteric coupling at the receptor–G protein interface.
Across three unrelated fold classes—all-α globin, α/β kinase, and 7TM GPCR—the curvature difference profile consistently detects established allosteric communication networks from backbone dihedrals alone (Table 4). In each case, the method recovers the mechanically transmitted component of conformational change—the strain redistribution that propagates through the fold—rather than the trigger site, establishing curvature modulation on T2 as a general conformational coordinate.
5. Conclusions
Applied to 8,008 human proteins on T2 (327,305 segments; null modeling on 557-protein high-confidence subset with Nrep = 5), inverse fold, and peak-decode analysis:
(1) Helices are curvature-enriched (65.1% vs 44.9% null, OR = 2.3, p < 10−10), reversing the 23-protein suppression finding.
(2) Strands are geodesic-dominated but carry measurable curvature structure beyond basin geometry (31.7% vs 11.4%, OR = 3.6, p < 10−10).
(3) Coil curvature-suppression observed in AlphaFold (28.4% vs 33.1%, p ≈ 10−20) is an AlphaFold artifact; PDB experimental structures show coil modulation at 45.2%, approaching helix levels. Helix and strand results replicate within 3%.
(4) Gaussian peaks are extrinsic—driven by side-chain packing (Leu 12.1%, Glu 8.7%) rather than backbone stereochemistry (Pro+Gly 10.8% ≈ baseline). The barcode captures fold-imposed strain rather than sequence-encoded backbone preferences.
(5) Peaks maintain territorial exclusion zones of ~10 residues (~3 helix turns), consistent with the cooperative length of the α-helix H-bond network. Peaks are independently positioned, not cooperatively phased.
(6) Backbone geometry alone recovers 18.3% top-1 sequence prediction accuracy (3.7× random), demonstrating that the (φ, ψ) trajectory on T2 encodes ~44% of the sequence entropy. The inverse fold produces position-specific amino acid probability matrices enabling geometric homology search.
(7) ψ-winding is globally negative (~90%), and |Q| separates structural classes.
(8) Geometric homology search achieves P@1 = 0.85 and MRR = 0.85 across 20 diverse queries (5,563 proteins), retrieving the correct fold-level homolog as the top hit for 17 of 20 queries. The curvature barcode achieves perfect retrieval across all-α, all-β, multi-domain TM, and chaperone classes, with top scores reaching 0.928 (HSP90α → HSP90β) and 0.926 (LDH-A → LDH-B). Performance degrades only for small/disordered proteins below ~200 residues.
(9) Curvature differences between conformational states localize to known allosteric communication networks in three unrelated fold classes: hemoglobin (all-α, 56% overlap, p = 7 × 10−4), ABL1 kinase (α/β, 100% overlap, p = 2 × 10−4), and β2-adrenergic receptor (7TM, 75% overlap, p = 0.02). In all three systems, the barcode detects the mechanical consequence of the conformational change—the strain propagation network—rather than the trigger site itself.
The curvature modulation framework reveals protein backbones as piecewise geodesics on T2 with fold-driven curvature events that encode both static tertiary structure and dynamic conformational states. The Ramachandran torus is not merely a steric feasibility space; it is a mechanical state space in which the trajectory’s curvature encodes the strain imposed by the fold. The curvature barcode provides a strain-architecture descriptor orthogonal to sequence alignment and 3D coordinate superposition, while curvature difference profiles detect allosteric communication networks from backbone geometry alone. The generality across three unrelated fold classes—spanning the major structural classes of signaling proteins—indicates that curvature modulation provides a universal readout of conformational state transitions.
