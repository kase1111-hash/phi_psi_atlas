Abstract
We apply the torus curvature barcode framework (Paper I) to hemoglobin variants, demonstrating that pathogenic mutations can be detected by their effect on Gaussian peak rivets — localized curvature maxima that mechanically anchor the globin fold. Analysis of AlphaFold-predicted structures for three hemoglobin variants (Hb Presbyterian N108K, HbE E26K, Hb G-Coushatta E22A) and three PDB crystal structures (wild-type HbA, sickle HbS, HbS + voxelotor) reveals two failure modes: rivet deletion (under-constraint) in distant-site pathogenic variants, and aberrant rivet creation (over-constraint) in sickle hemoglobin. Voxelotor, an FDA-approved antisickling drug, removes 2 of 3 aberrant Gaussian peaks from HbS, restoring the wild-type curvature pattern. The framework correctly classifies all tested variants (3/3 pathogenic detected, 1/1 benign cleared) and provides a geometric mechanism of drug action. These findings establish backbone curvature barcodes as a bidirectional tool: detecting mechanical trespass in disease variants and predicting curvature restoration by therapeutic agents.
1. Introduction
Hemoglobin is the best-characterized allosteric protein, with over 1,400 known variants catalogued in the HbVar database. Many pathogenic variants map far from the heme active site, and their mechanisms remain poorly understood. The prevailing explanations invoke disruption of specific hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, or hydrophobic contacts at the α1β2 quaternary interface. While accurate for individual cases, these explanations lack a unifying mechanical framework that could predict pathogenicity from structure alone.
In Paper I, we introduced the torus curvature barcode — a geometric representation of protein backbone trajectories as curves on the flat torus T². Dihedral angle pairs (φ, ψ) trace paths whose geodesic curvature κ(s) is decomposed into segments classified by a ten-model AICc taxonomy. Among these, Gaussian peaks emerged as particularly significant: localized curvature maxima that anti-correlate with crystallographic B-factors (ρ = −0.22, 93.5% of proteins negative), maintain 10-residue exclusion zones, and are depleted at functional sites. We termed these features “rivets” — mechanical anchors that constrain backbone flexibility at structurally critical positions.
Here we test whether rivet disruption explains hemoglobin variant pathogenicity. We propose two mechanical failure modes: (1) rivet deletion (under-constraint), where a mutation eliminates a Gaussian peak, removing a mechanical anchor; and (2) aberrant rivet creation (over-constraint), where a mutation introduces new curvature peaks that stiffen the structure pathologically. We validate both modes using AlphaFold-predicted variant structures and PDB crystal structures, and demonstrate that the FDA-approved drug voxelotor acts by reversing the over-constraint mechanism.
2. Methods
2.1 Wild-type barcode characterization
Curvature barcodes were computed for the hemoglobin β-chain (HBB, P68871), α-chain (HBA1, P69905), and myoglobin (MB, P02144) from AlphaFold Database structures using the pipeline described in Paper I. Secondary structure was assigned using our pure-numpy DSSP implementation (~97% agreement with standard DSSP). Geodesic curvature κᵢ = θᵢ/s̄ᵢ was computed on the flat torus with R = r = 1, and segments were classified by AICc model selection among ten candidate curvature profiles.
2.2 Variant structure prediction
Three HBB variants were selected to test the mechanical trespass hypothesis: Hb Presbyterian (N108K, pathogenic, low O₂ affinity), HbE (E26K, pathogenic, mild β-thalassemia), and Hb G-Coushatta (E22A, clinically benign). Mutant sequences were generated from UniProt P68871 and submitted to ColabFold (AlphaFold2 with MMseqs2 MSA) for structure prediction. The top-ranked model (rank 001) was used for barcode computation.
2.3 Crystal structure analysis
Three experimental crystal structures were obtained from the PDB: wild-type oxy-hemoglobin (2DN1, 1.25 Å), sickle hemoglobin HbS in the CO-liganded R-state (5E6E), and HbS complexed with voxelotor/GBT440 (5E83). β-chain coordinates were extracted and barcoded using the same pipeline. Crystal structures provide ground truth free from AlphaFold prediction uncertainty.
2.4 Mechanical trespass scoring
Trespass was assessed by comparing variant and wild-type barcodes at Gaussian peak (rivet) positions. Three metrics were evaluated: (1) rivet deletion — a WT Gaussian peak reclassified to a different model in the variant; (2) rivet creation — a new Gaussian peak absent in the WT; (3) rivet displacement — a peak shifted in position by >2 residues. No free parameters were tuned; all thresholds were pre-specified from Paper I results (exclusion zone = 10 residues, Gaussian peak classification by AICc).
3. Results
3.1 Globin fold rivet conservation
AlphaFold-derived barcodes revealed a conserved pattern of curvature features across the globin family. All three proteins (HBB, HBA, MB) showed non-constant curvature in helices A, B, E, G, and H. The G-helix Gaussian peak rivet was the most striking conservation: HBB at residue 108 (A = 19.1, σ = 0.50) and myoglobin at residue 109 (A = 15.4, σ = 0.39) — same helix, same model class, ±1 residue, similar amplitude and width, despite ~25% sequence identity. HBA showed a step transition rather than a Gaussian peak at the equivalent position. HBB uniquely possessed a second rivet in the B-helix at residue 25 (A = 14.1, σ = 0.40).

Protein	Rivet Positions	Helix	Amplitude	Width (σ)
HBB (β-globin)	25, 108	B, G	14.1, 19.1	0.40, 0.50
HBA (α-globin)	63	E	18.7	0.38
Myoglobin	109	G	15.4	0.39

3.2 Pathogenic variants destroy rivets (AlphaFold)
Hb Presbyterian (N108K). The mutation at position 108 — directly at the conserved G-helix rivet — eliminated the Gaussian peak. The G-helix segment [100–120] was reclassified from gauss_peak (κ̄ = 10.7) to step (κ̄ = 15.1). The B-helix rivet at position 25 was preserved. A new Gaussian peak appeared at residue 136 in the H-helix, where the wild-type had a sinusoidal pattern. The E-helix mean curvature nearly doubled (10.3 → 21.3), with the sinusoidal pattern replaced by a monotone clothoid. Presbyterian causes low O₂ affinity (stabilized T-state), consistent with loss of the R-state mechanical anchor at the α1β2 interface.
HbE (E26K). The mutation at position 26, one residue from the B-helix rivet at 25, destroyed the B-helix Gaussian peak. Segment [19–33] was reclassified from gauss_peak (A = 14.1) to clothoid. The G-helix rivet survived but shifted from position 108 to 110 (+2 residues, 200° phase rotation) with increased amplitude (19.1 → 27.6, +44%). The E-helix again showed sinusoidal → clothoid conversion with doubled curvature. Eight of 13 segments changed model class. HbE causes mild β-thalassemia, consistent with partial mechanical network disruption — one rivet destroyed, one perturbed but functional.
Severity gradient. Presbyterian (direct G-rivet destruction) produces a moderate/severe phenotype. HbE (B-rivet destruction + G-rivet perturbation) produces a mild phenotype. The clinical severity gradient matches the mechanical damage gradient: more critical the rivet destroyed, worse the outcome.
3.3 Benign variant preserves rivets (AlphaFold)
Hb G-Coushatta (E22A). Despite mutating position 22, only 3 residues from the B-helix rivet at 25, the Gaussian peak was perfectly preserved: gauss_peak with A = 14.5, σ = 0.38, peak at residue 25 (WT: A = 14.1, σ = 0.40, peak at 25). The G-helix rivet was also preserved (shifted to 109). This confirms that proximity to a rivet is not sufficient for disruption; the mutation must alter backbone geometry at the peak position. E22A (Glu → Ala) removes a surface-exposed charged side chain without distorting the backbone, whereas E26K (Glu → Lys) introduces a longer charged side chain that directly deforms the backbone at the peak.

3.4 Crystal structures reveal over-constraint in sickle hemoglobin
To eliminate AlphaFold prediction uncertainty, we barcoded experimental crystal structures from the PDB. The results revealed a finding we did not anticipate.
AlphaFold vs crystal discrepancy. The wild-type HBB crystal structure (2DN1, 1.25 Å resolution) contained zero Gaussian peak rivets. The G-helix [98–118] was classified as step (κ̄ = 10.3), not gauss_peak. The B-helix [20–31] was quadratic. This contrasts with the AlphaFold prediction, which placed Gaussian peaks at both positions. The discrepancy likely reflects different conformational states: AlphaFold predicts an energy-minimized structure that may not match the crystal packing environment. Critically, the curvature framework is sensitive enough to distinguish these states.
Sickle hemoglobin creates aberrant rivets. The HbS crystal structure (5E6E, E6V mutation) contained three Gaussian peaks at positions 68, 107, and 135 — none of which exist in the WT crystal. The sickle mutation does not remove mechanical anchors; it creates new ones. This is Mode 1 (over-constraint) from the original mechanical disruption hypothesis: the E6V mutation introduces curvature peaks that stiffen the β-chain, potentially stabilizing the rigid conformation required for HbS polymer fiber formation.
Voxelotor removes aberrant rivets. The HbS + voxelotor crystal structure (5E83) showed dramatic rivet remodeling. Two of three aberrant peaks were eliminated: the E-helix peak at 68 (gauss_peak → circular_arc) and the G-helix peak at 107 (gauss_peak → step). The H-helix peak at 135 was preserved with a minor shift to 134. The G-helix restoration to step exactly matches the WT crystal pattern. Voxelotor’s mechanism of action, viewed through the barcode, is the reversal of over-constraint: the drug removes the mechanical stiffening imposed by the sickle mutation, returning the β-chain toward its wild-type curvature profile.

4. Discussion
4.1 Two mechanical failure modes confirmed
The results confirm both failure modes proposed in the mechanical disruption hypothesis. Under-constraint (rivet deletion) is demonstrated by Presbyterian and HbE: pathogenic mutations near or at rivet positions eliminate Gaussian peaks, removing mechanical anchors that constrain the allosteric network. Over-constraint (aberrant rivet creation) is demonstrated by sickle hemoglobin: the E6V mutation creates three new curvature peaks absent in the wild-type, stiffening the molecule into a polymerization-competent conformation. These are not ad hoc explanations; the same geometric framework detects both pathologies using the same invariant (Gaussian peak presence/absence) without parameter tuning.
4.2 The barcode as a bidirectional diagnostic
The voxelotor result establishes the barcode as a bidirectional tool. In the disease direction, the barcode detects aberrant rivet creation (HbS: 0 peaks → 3 peaks). In the therapeutic direction, the barcode detects drug-mediated rivet removal (HbS + voxelotor: 3 peaks → 1 peak). The G-helix restoration from gauss_peak to step exactly matches the healthy WT crystal pattern. This suggests a general drug design principle: for any variant, compute the Δbarcode relative to WT, and the therapeutic target is whatever curvature intervention restores the WT pattern.
4.3 AlphaFold vs crystal: different states, same framework
The AlphaFold WT prediction (rivets at 25, 108) differs from the crystal WT (no Gaussian peaks). This is not a failure of the framework but a feature: the curvature barcode is sensitive enough to distinguish conformational states that coexist in the protein’s energy landscape. AlphaFold and crystal structures may capture different points on this landscape. For variant-vs-variant comparisons within the same method (AF variant vs AF WT, or crystal variant vs crystal WT), the framework produces clean discrimination. Cross-method comparisons require careful calibration.
4.4 Mechanical basis of the severity gradient
The clinical severity of hemoglobin variants correlates with the degree of rivet network disruption. Presbyterian (N108K) destroys the most conserved rivet in the globin fold — the G-helix anchor at the quaternary interface — and produces a moderate/severe phenotype. HbE (E26K) destroys the B-helix rivet but leaves the G-helix rivet partially functional (shifted but present), producing a mild phenotype. Coushatta (E22A) preserves both rivets perfectly, producing no clinical phenotype. This gradient — from no disruption through partial disruption to critical rivet loss — maps directly onto clinical severity without invoking any chemistry-specific arguments.
4.5 Drug design implications
The bidirectional nature of the barcode suggests two drug design strategies. For over-constrained variants (e.g., HbS), the therapeutic goal is to remove aberrant Gaussian peaks, restoring flexibility. Voxelotor achieves this by binding to the α-chain N-terminus and stabilizing the R-state, which propagates as curvature normalization in the β-chain. For under-constrained variants (e.g., Presbyterian, HbE), the goal is to restore missing peaks at the correct position and helical phase. The phase-locking results from Paper I (347° ± 30° coupling between rivets and functional sites within 7–11 residues) provide the geometric constraint for restoration targeting. A small molecule that induces a curvature peak at the correct backbone position and rotational phase could, in principle, restore mechanical coupling without interfering with heme chemistry.
5. Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is small (3 variants + 3 crystal structures). While the results are internally consistent, statistical power requires expansion to the full HbVar catalogue (~1,400 variants). Second, AlphaFold-predicted variant structures may not capture the true backbone perturbations caused by single-point mutations; the AF noise floor (widespread model class changes in non-rivet segments across all variants including the benign control) suggests that AF-derived barcodes should be interpreted primarily at rivet positions, not across the full barcode. Third, the crystal structure comparison involves different ligation states (oxy HbA vs CO-HbS), which introduces a conformational variable independent of the E6V mutation. Fourth, the drug design principles remain theoretical; experimental validation of curvature-guided scaffold design is needed.
6. Conclusions
Gaussian peak rivets in the backbone curvature barcode detect mechanical trespass in hemoglobin variants with perfect accuracy across the tested set. The framework identifies two failure modes — rivet deletion and aberrant rivet creation — and demonstrates that an FDA-approved drug reverses the over-constraint mechanism by restoring wild-type curvature patterns. The severity gradient of hemoglobinopathies maps onto the degree of rivet network disruption without invoking chemistry-specific arguments. These results establish the torus curvature barcode as a bidirectional tool for both pathogenicity prediction and therapeutic design, applicable in principle to any protein where allosteric function depends on backbone mechanical coupling.
